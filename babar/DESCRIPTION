Title: Bayesian Bacterial Growth Curve Analysis in R
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-11-13
Author: Lydia Rickett, Matthew Hartley, Richard Morris and Nick Pullen
Maintainer: Matthew Hartley <Matthew.Hartley@jic.ac.uk>
Description: Babar is designed to use nested sampling (a Bayesian analysis technique) to compare possible models for bacterial growth curves, as well as extracting parameters. It allows model evidence and parameter likelihood values to be extracted, and also contains helper functions for comparing distributions as well as direct access to the underlying nested sampling code.
