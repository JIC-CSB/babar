# Comparing distributions with nested sampling

A common problem in the analysis of experimental data is deciding when 

```{r}
library(babar)
```



# Let's first generate some data. We'll set a number of samples:

```{r}
n.samples <- 500
```

# Then set two different means and standard deviations:

```{r}
sd.1 <- 2
mean.1 <- 0

sd.2 <- 2
mean.2 <- 1
```{r}

# Now we'll generate three sets of samples. Two have the same mean and
# standard deviation and the third is different.

```{r}
data.a <- rnorm(n.samples, mean.1, sd.1)
data.b <- rnorm(n.samples, mean.1, sd.1)
data.c <- rnorm(n.samples, mean.2, sd.2)
```

```{r}
compareDistributions(data.a, data.b)
compareDistributions(data.a, data.c)
```
